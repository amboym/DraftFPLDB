# DraftFPL Database (RUGFPL2023)
## Introduction
I developed a comprehensive database capable of storing weekly player statistics sourced from user-selected teams via the Draft Fantasy Premier League API. This project was created for the 2023 Fantasy League involving 8 of my friends in a league called RUGFPL2023. The purpose was to ensure that our stats would be saved throughout the years (as FPL does not store draft league data), enable functionality of querying player comparisons and team performance, and facilitate the creation of an infographic at the end of the season that provides an overview of the league and each team's performance.

An advantage of having stored this database in SQL, is because of its connection
to Tableau. For each year, I intend to keep this database running for each year we play
so that we have a historical record of standings /players. Having this database is also handy
since at the end of the year i would like to make an infographic of the whole league - highlighting
top performers, who got fleeced in a trade ,etc. But for now (GW 25 out of GW 38), I have made a visualization that 
shows the points distribution of each team grouped by position.
