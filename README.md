# DraftFPL Database (RUGFPL2023)
## Introduction
I developed a comprehensive database capable of storing weekly player statistics sourced from user-selected teams via the Draft Fantasy Premier League API. This project was created for the 2023 Fantasy League involving 8 of my friends in a league called RUGFPL2023. The purpose was to ensure that our stats would be saved throughout the years (as FPL does not store draft league data), enable functionality of querying player comparisons and team performance, and facilitate the creation of an infographic at the end of the season that provides an overview of the league and each team's performance.

An advantage of storing this database in SQL is its seamless integration with Tableau. By maintaining the database for each year of play, we ensure a comprehensive historical record of standings and players. This database proves invaluable at the end of each year, facilitating the creation of infographics summarizing the entire league season, highlighting top performers and notable events such as impactful trades. Currently, at Gameweek 25 out of 38, I've already crafted a visualization showcasing the points distribution of each team, grouped by position.
